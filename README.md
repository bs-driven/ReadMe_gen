## READ ME

## MOTIVATION

    The goal of this project is to produce a high quailty read me from the coomand line. A person is prompted to answer a few question in which thier input is then used in a README that will populate once the questions have been answered.

## Problems

    The problem I faced was figuring out how the ReadMe should look. Off the top of my head I did'nt know what inquirer types to use. Something as simple as list and choices not being one in the same. Once I had it finished and ran it a few time I found that I had a extra comma in my inquirer questions that hung me up at a point as well.

## What I Learned

    I learned the diffent types that can be used and not used in a inquirer.prompt. I learned to actually produce a ReadME from the command line. i learned about the diffeerent licenses that can be used for a read me.

## Stand Out

    The almighty question of what makes this standout well I wish I had a real answer.Yet I'm not sure what makes this project stand out it displays some of my talent and shows my ability to create a function to run at the start with the init function. Displays my use of inquirer as well. One thing you can notice is I dont make my reads thte way I was able to produce one. I'm use to this read me rather then the one thats produced from the command line
